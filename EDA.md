        "* One of the most fascinating datasets that I've come across is the Ames Housing dataset. It was originally collated by Dr. Dean De Cock (Truman State Univ) for the undergraduate statistical methods course, and later became very popular through Kaggle. \n",
        "* It contains a diverse and large set of information captured at the point of sale of houses in Ames (Iowa, US) from 2006 to 2010. Information about the location, sizing, context of sale, condition of rooms and much more is provided. \n",
        "* One of the popular \"tasks\" on this dataset to try and predict the Sale Price from the attributes of the house - its location, size, quality, etc. But there can be other interesting \"tasks\".\n",
        "* While Kaggle split the data into train and test sets, the original dataset is complete and contains a few extra columns. "
